For your specific project (WebSpy), given the current context from the code and readme, a possible project structure could be:

```
WebSpy/
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── setup.py
├── requirements.txt
├── webspy/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── core.py
│   ├── helpers.py
│   └── credentials.json
├── docs/
│   ├── conf.py
│   └── index.rst
└── tests/
    ├── test_basic.py
    └── test_advanced.py
```

This project structure follows some of the best practices and guidelines for organizing a Python project, such as:

- Using a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies from your system's Python installation. You can use tools such as venv, virtualenv, or conda to create and manage virtual environments. You should also include a requirements.txt file that lists all the packages and versions that your project needs, and use pip freeze > requirements.txt to generate it. This will make it easier for other developers to install and run your project.
- Using a consistent naming convention for your files, folders, modules, classes, functions, and variables. You should follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code, which provides coding conventions and best practices for writing Python code. Some of the main rules are: use lowercase for variables and functions, CamelCase for classes, UPPERCASE for constants, and underscores to separate words in names.
- Writing a README file that gives a clear and concise overview of your project, such as what it does, how to install and use it, how to contribute to it, etc. You should also include a LICENSE file that specifies the terms of use and distribution of your project. If you are not sure which license to choose, you can check out choosealicense.com for some guidance.
- Writing a setup.py file that allows you to package and distribute your project using tools such as setuptools or distutils. This file contains information about your project's name, version, description, dependencies, etc. You can also use this file to define custom commands or options for your project.
- Organizing your code into modules and packages that are logically related and have clear interfaces. You should place your main module package (webspy) in the root of your project directory, and use __init__.py files to mark subdirectories as packages. You should also separate your configuration files (such as credentials.json) from your code files (such as core.py or helpers.py).
- Writing documentation for your project using tools such as Sphinx or MkDocs. You should place your documentation files (such as conf.py or index.rst) in a separate docs directory in your project directory. You should also write docstrings for your modules, classes, functions, and methods following the PEP 257 conventions.
- Writing tests for your code using a testing framework such as unittest or pytest. You should place your test files (such as test_basic.py or test_advanced.py) in a separate tests directory in your project directory. You should also use descriptive names for your test cases and methods, and follow the arrange-act-assert pattern for writing tests.
